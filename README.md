## Overview : 
This repo holds my solutions to the gossip glomers Challenges that has a series of challenges built using `maelstorm` sdk (go and rust). These are a bunch of introductory distributed system challenges that I think give a good first look into dist sys. I personally found them not so challenging.

## Notes on Challenges : 

### Challenge-1 : Echo

### Challenge-2 : 

### Challenge-3a : 
### Challenge-3b : 
### Challenge-3c : 
### Challenge-3d : 
### Challenge-3e :

### Challenge-4 :
### Challenge-5a :
### Challenge-5b :
### Challenge-5c :
### Challenge-6a :
### Challenge-6b :
### Challenge-6c :




### Notes on topics : 

#### Sequential consistency 
Sequential consistency is a strong safety property for concurrent systems. Informally, sequential consistency implies that operations appear to take place in some total order, and that that order is consistent with the order of operations on each individual process.

> Sequential consistency cannot provide gaurentees of ordering across processes

#### Linearizability
