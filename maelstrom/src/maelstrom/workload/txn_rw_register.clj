(ns maelstrom.workload.txn-rw-register
  "A transactional workload over a map of keys to values. Clients
  submit a single transaction via a `txn` request, and expect a
  completed version of that transaction in a `txn_ok` response.

  A transaction is an array of micro-operations, which should be executed in
  order:

  ```edn
  [op1, op2, ...]
  ```

  Each micro-op is a 3-element array comprising a function, key, and value:

  ```edn
  [f, k, v]
  ```

  There are two functions. A *read* observes the current value of a specific
  key. `[\"r\", 5, [1, 2]]` denotes that a read of key 5 observed the list `[1,
  2]`. When clients submit reads, they leave their values `null`:  `[\"r\", 5,
  null]`. The server processing the transaction should replace that value with
  whatever the observed value is for that key: `[\"r\", 5, [1, 2]]`.

  A *write* replaces the value for a key. For instance, `[\"w\", 5, 3]` means
  \"set key 5's value to 3\". Write values are provided by the client, and are
  returned unchanged.

  For example, assume the current state of the database is `{1 8}`, and you
  receive a request body like:

  ```json
  {\"type\": \"txn\",
   \"msg_id\": 1,
   \"txn\": [[\"r\", 1, null], [\"w\", 1, 6], [\"w\", 2, 9]]}
  ```

  You might return a response like:

  ```json
  {\"type\": \"txn_ok\",
   \"in_reply_to\": 1,
   \"txn\": [[\"r\", 1, 8], [\"w\", 1, 6], [\"w\", 2, 9]]}
  ```

  First you read the current value of key 1, returning the value 8. Then you
  set key 1 to 6. Then you set key 2 to 9, implicitly creating it. The
  resulting state of the database would be `{1 6, 2 9}`.

  Writes in this workload are always integers, and are unique per key. Key
  `x` will only ever see at most one write of `0`, at most one write of `1`,
  and so on.

  Unlike lin-kv, nonexistent keys should be returned as `null`. Keys are
  implicitly created on first write.

  This workload can check many kinds of consistency models. See the
  `--consistency-models` CLI option for details. Right now it only uses
  writes-follow-reads within individual transactions to infer version
  orders--this severely limits the transaction dependencies it can infer. We
  can make this configurable later."
