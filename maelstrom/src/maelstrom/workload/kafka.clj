(ns maelstrom.workload.kafka
  "A simplified version of a Kafka-style stream processing system. Servers
  provide a set of append-only logs identified by string *keys*. Each integer
  *offset* in a log has one *message*. Offsets may be sparse: not every offset
  must contain a message.

  A client appends a message to a log by making a `send` RPC request with the
  key and value they want to append; the server responds with the offset it
  assigned for that particular message.

  To read a log, a client issues a `poll` RPC request with a map of keys to the
  offsets it wishes to read beginning at. The server returns a `poll_ok`
  response containing a map of keys to vectors of `[offset, message]` pairs,
  beginning at the requested offset for that key.

  Servers should maintain a *committed offset* for each key. Clients can
  request that this offset be advanced by making a `commit_offsets` RPC
  request, with a map of keys to the highest offsets which that client has
  processed. Clients can also fetch known-committed offsets for a given set of
  keys through a `fetch_committed_offsets` request.

  The checker for this workload detects a number of anomalies.

  If a client observes (e.g.) offset 10 of key `k1`, but *not* offset 5, and we
  know that offset 5 exists, we call that a *lost write*. If we know offset 11
  exists, but it is never observed in a poll, we call that write *unobserved*.
  There is no recency requirement: servers are free to acknowledge a sent
  message, but not return it in any polls for an arbitrarily long time.

  Ideally, we expect client offsets from both sends and polls to be strictly
  monotonically increasing, and to observe every message. If offsets go
  backwards--e.g. if a client observes offset 4 then 2, or 2 then 2--we call
  that *nonomonotonic*. It's an *internal nonmonotonic* error if offsets fail
  to increase in the course of a single transaction, or single poll. It's an
  *external nonmonotonic* error if offsets fail to increase *between* two
  transactions.

  If we skip over an offset that we know exists, we call that a *skip*. Like
  nonmonotonic errors, a skip error can be internal (in a single transaction or
  poll) or external (between two transactions). For example, here is a
  poll-skip anomaly:

  ```edn
  {:key \"56\",
   :delta 3,
   :skipped (7 8),
   :ops [#jepsen.history.Op{:index 3820,
                            :time 4650651388,
                            :type :ok,
                            :process 0,
                            :f :poll,
                            :value [[:poll {\"56\" [[4 5] [5 6]]}]]}
         #jepsen.history.Op{:index 3848,
                            :time 4691738701,
                            :type :ok,
                            :process 0,
                            :f :poll,
                            :value [[:poll {\"56\" [[8 9]]}]]}]}
  ```

  Here a single client (process 0) performed two polls in succession, both of
  which observed key \"56\". The first poll observed offsets 4 and 5 (with
  messages 5 and 6). The second poll observed offset 8, with message 9. The
  client unexpectedly jumped three offsets ahead, skipping messages 7 and 8.

  The Jepsen client performs `:assign` operations, which is analogous to the
  Kafka client's `assign`: it picks a new set of keys and offsets for
  successive `poll` operations. On assign, the client fetches committed offsets
  from the server and begins polling from those positions. Since we expect the
  offset to change on assign, external nonmonotonic and skip errors are not
  tracked across `assign` operations."
