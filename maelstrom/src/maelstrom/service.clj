  "Services are Maelstrom-provided nodes which offer things like 'a
  linearizable key-value store', 'a source of sequentially-assigned
  timestamps', 'an eventually-consistent immutable key-value store', 'a
  sequentially consistent FIFO queue', and so on. Your nodes can use these as
  primitives for building more sophisticated systems.

  For instance, if you're trying to build a transactional, serializable
  database, you might build it as a layer on top of an existing linearizable
  per-key kv store--say, several distinct Raft groups, one per shard. In
  Maelstrom, you'd write your nodes to accept transaction requests, then (in
  accordance with your chosen transaction protocol) make your own key-value
  requests to the `lin-kv` service."
